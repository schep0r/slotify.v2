# Codeception Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated the project from PHPUnit to Codeception as the primary testing framework. The migration maintains all existing test functionality while providing better Symfony integration and BDD-style testing capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Testing Documentation (TESTING.md)
- Removed PHPUnit-specific instructions
- Added comprehensive Codeception documentation
- Updated examples and best practices
- Added coverage reporting instructions

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/tests.yml)
- Replaced PHPUnit commands with Codeception
- Updated coverage generation to use Codeception
- Fixed artifact paths for Codeception output
- Updated test result publishing

### 3. Updated Composer Scripts (composer.json)
- `composer test` - Run all Codeception tests
- `composer test-unit` - Run unit tests only
- `composer test-functional` - Run functional tests only
- `composer test-acceptance` - Run acceptance tests only
- `composer test-coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `composer test-coverage-text` - Run tests with text coverage
- `composer codecept-build` - Build Codeception actors

### 4. Updated Dependencies
- Added `codeception/module-rest` for API testing
- Removed deprecated `codeception/module-doctrine2`
- Updated to use `codeception/module-doctrine` for database testing

### 5. Fixed Codeception Configuration
- Updated namespace configuration in `codeception.yml`
- Fixed suite configurations for Unit, Functional, and Acceptance tests
- Added proper coverage settings with exclusions
- Fixed Tester class namespaces

### 6. Updated Steering Files
- Updated `tech.md` to reflect Codeception as primary testing framework
- Updated common commands and examples

### 7. Marked PHPUnit as Deprecated
- Added deprecation notice to `phpunit.xml`
- Kept PHPUnit configuration for backward compatibility

## Test Results

### Current Test Status
- **Unit Tests**: 33 tests, 1103 assertions ✅
- **Functional Tests**: 1 test ✅
- **Acceptance Tests**: 0 tests (ready for future tests)

### Coverage Report
- **Classes**: 4.44% (2/45)
- **Methods**: 17.42% (54/310)
- **Lines**: 11.67% (208/1782)

Coverage thresholds configured:
- Low limit: 50%
- High limit: 90%

## Available Commands

### Running Tests
```bash
# All tests
composer test
vendor/bin/codecept run

# Specific suites
composer test-unit
composer test-functional
composer test-acceptance

# With coverage
composer test-coverage
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage vendor/bin/codecept run --coverage --coverage-html

# Debug mode
vendor/bin/codecept run --debug
```

### Building Actors
```bash
vendor/bin/codecept build
```

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Better Symfony Integration**: Native support for Symfony framework testing
2. **BDD-Style Testing**: More readable test scenarios
3. **Database Testing**: Automatic cleanup and fixtures support
4. **Multiple Test Types**: Unit, Functional, and Acceptance tests in one framework
5. **Better API Testing**: Built-in REST module for API testing
6. **Comprehensive Coverage**: HTML, XML, and text coverage reports

## Next Steps

1. **Write More Tests**: Expand test coverage, especially for controllers and services
2. **Add Acceptance Tests**: Create end-to-end API tests
3. **Database Fixtures**: Set up proper test fixtures for functional tests
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Ensure GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
5. **Coverage Improvement**: Work towards meeting the 50% minimum coverage threshold

## Migration Verification

✅ Codeception builds successfully  
✅ Unit tests run and pass  
✅ Functional tests run and pass  
✅ Coverage generation works  
✅ Composer scripts work  
✅ GitHub Actions workflow updated  
✅ Documentation updated  

The migration is complete and the testing infrastructure is ready for development.
